# ROLOS: Separating Signal from Noise in Car Racing Communication
This is the README file from  Constructor Learning's students' final project on identifying key messages in the radio communications of auto racing teams using NLP machine and deep learning techniques. For privacy reasons, there is no additional data or code added, please contact Kai Braeunig for any questions.

The project was done in collaboration with ROLOS.

## Purpose
The goal of the project is to help engineers focus on high-priority messages by distinguishing important information from noise.

ROLOS' and the students' approach involves recording real-time radio communications, audio transcription of every single message, and using NLP machine and deep learning techniques to classify and identify key messages. The result is a highly efficient system that ensures engineers focus only on the essential messages that can affect the race.
